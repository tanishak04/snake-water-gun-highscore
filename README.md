📌 Snake Water Gun – High Score Saver

This is my continued Python mini-project where I upgraded my Snake–Water–Gun game by adding a file-handling based result saver.

The game now:

records whether the player Won (w), Lost (l) or Drew (g)

saves every result inside a text file

reads all saved results

counts total wins, losses, and draws

displays the stats at the end of every game

🧠 What I Learned

How to use functions and return values properly

The real use-case of global variables

File handling modes: a, w, r, and when to use each

How to read text, store outcomes, and convert them into stats

How to separate logic into smaller, cleaner parts

📂 Files in this project

game.py → Main game + high score saver

tictactoe.txt → Stores results as g/w/l

🚀 Why this project matters

This small upgrade taught me how programs save data, how function flow works in real logic, and how to structure code better.
